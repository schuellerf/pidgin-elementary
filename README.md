# pidgin-elementary

This is a very simple status icon theme for Pidgin to match the elementary icon theme, released under GPLv2+ like its bigger brother, elementary-xfce.

It follows Pidgin's status icon specification: https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/StatusIconThemes

## Install ##

Create a folder "elementary" in ~./purple/themes, e.g. in the Bash:
`mkdir ~/.purple/themes/elementary`

Then extract copy the content of the "purple" folder to that directory and select the theme in Pidgin.
